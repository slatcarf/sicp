; Consider a Scheme function g for which the expression
; ((g) 1)
; returns the value 3 when evaluated. Determine how many arguments g has. In one word, also describe as
; best you can the type of value returned by g.

; `g` must have 0 arguments, since it is called without providing an argument
; The type of value returned by `g` is a procedure with one argument.
